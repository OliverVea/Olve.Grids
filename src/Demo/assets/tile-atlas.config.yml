# It is optional. If not present, adjacencies will be generated from brushes and weights will be set to 1

# Configure tile weights
weights:

    weight: 0.1
    mode: multiply # Default. This will multiply the weight with the existing weight
    #   mode: add # This will add the weight to the existing weight
    #   mode: set # This will set the weight to the new value

  - group: full-dark
    weight: 4

  - group: diagonals
    weight: 0.1

  - tiles: 21

# Groups are used to define a set of tiles that share the same weight
# They are not necessary but can be useful to avoid repeating the same group of tiles
